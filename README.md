Motion synthesis in a dynamic environment has been a long-standing problem for character animation. Methods using motion capture data tend to scale poorly in complex environments because of their larger capturing and labeling requirement. Physics-based controllers are effective in this regard, albeit less controllable. In this paper, we present CARL, a quadruped agent that can be controlled with high-level directives and react naturally to dynamic environments. Starting with an agent that can imitate individual animation clips, we use Generative Adversarial Networks to adapt high-level controls, such as speed and heading, to action distributions that correspond to the original animations. Further fine-tuning through the deep reinforcement learning enables the agent to recover from unseen external perturbations while producing smooth transitions. It then becomes straightforward to create autonomous agents in dynamic environments by adding navigation modules over the entire process. We evaluate our approach by measuring the agent's ability to follow user control and provide a visual analysis of the generated motion to show its effectiveness.

# Reference Motions

We use a readily available kinematic controller called Mode Adaptive Neural Network (MANN) by [Zhang et al. 2018] (visit their repository at https://github.com/sebastianstarke/AI4Animation for more detail) to get the reference motions. The system doesn't require such specific animation system to work. Motion graphs or motion capture data are also viable alternatives to use.

For your convenience, we provided reference motions for both speed and heading control tasks located in `data/motions/`.

Inspired by [DeepMimic](https://github.com/xbpeng/DeepMimic), the motion files follow the JSON format. The "Loop" field specifies whether or not the motion is cyclic. "wrap" specifies a cyclic motion that will wrap back to the start at the end, while "none" specifies an acyclic motion that will stop once it reaches the end of the motion. Each vector in the "Frames" list specifies a keyframe in the motion. Each frame has the following format:
```
[
    duration of frame in seconds (1D),
    root position (3D),
    root rotation (4D),
    hips rotation (4D),
    spine rotation (4D),
    spine1 rotation (4D),
    neck rotation (4D),
    head rotation (4D),
    head site rotation (4D),
    left shoulder rotation (4D),
    left arm rotation (4D),
    left fore arm rotation (4D),
    left hand rotation (4D),
    left hand side rotation (4D),
    right shoulder rotation (4D),
    right arm rotation (4D),
    right fore arm rotation (4D),
    right hand rotation (4D),
    right hand side rotation (4D),
    left up leg rotation (4D),
    left leg rotation (4D),
    left foot rotation (4D),
    left foot site rotation (4D),
    right up leg rotation (4D),
    right leg rotation (4D),
    right foot rotation (4D),
    right foot site rotation (4D),
    tail rotation (4D),
    tail1 rotation (4D),
    tail1 site rotation (4D)
]
```
Positions are specified in meters and 3D rotations for spherical joints are specified as quaternions (w, x, y, z). The root positions and rotations are in world coordinates, but all other joint rotations are in the joint's local coordinates. To use your motion clip, convert it to a similar style JSON file.

# Known Issues and Solutions

Q: Crash with message `"util/MathUtil.cpp:175: static tMatrix cMathUtil::RotateMat(const tVector &, double): Assertion std::abs(axis.squaredNorm() - 1) < 0.0001' failed."` after throwing random boxes.

A: You can adjust the equation `std::abs(axis.squaredNorm() - 1) < 0.0001` in file `DeepMimic/DeepMimicCore/util/MathUtil.cpp`, from value `0.0001` to `0.1`, and re-compile CarlCore.
